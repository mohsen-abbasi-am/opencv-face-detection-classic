# 👁️ Classic Face Detection with OpenCV (Haar Cascade)

This project demonstrates face detection using **traditional image processing** techniques in OpenCV, specifically the **Haar Cascade classifier**.

## 📌 What is Haar Cascade?

Haar Cascade is a machine vision technique based on predefined patterns (features) used to detect objects like faces. It’s fast and works without deep learning.
